OPTIONS FOR DISPLAYING PAGES:
- Each page has its own HTML, CSS, and JS (some may be common).
- All share the same page, which means that each item is overwritten
  rather than being loaded in.

EACH PAGE VIEW SHOULD HAVE
- Run button: runs the currently selected network.
- Console output: displays useful output from the network
  (eg. confusion matrices, accuracy, etc.)
- Scatter plot: displays accuracy percentage against epochs for both
  training and testing.

> CONTROLS
  > GROUP (runs the network)
    > BUTTON: run
  > GROUP (saves weights at specified epoch to file)
    > NUMBER: epoch number
    > BUTTON: save weights

> INFORMATION
  > CONSOLE (displays output from network: confusion matrices, accuracy, etc.)
  > CHART (a scatter plot displaying accuracy percentage against epochs
    for training and testing)

IN ANY CASE, all networks will be loaded into memory throughout the lifetime
of the program. Therefore, it would be best that the displaying of data and the
running of the networks be separate. Otherwise if all networks were run, every
network would then also attempt to display themselves (or at least update
themselves which is still bad).

IF all use same page:
  loadPage() {
    // Loads page into already displayed elements.
    // All Javascript and CSS must already by available and loaded.
  }
ELSE IF all use separate pages:
  loadPage() {
    // Loads page from file and replaces 'body' element with the loaded
    // data.
    // Can load Javascript and CSS solely for that page. However, this means
    // that this must be loaded every time the page is loaded.
  }
